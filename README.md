# SQL Database Usage in C#

A simple project made in C# connected to a SQL Database with the use of ADO.net entity model. This was my first usage of ADO.net.
The application retrieves all the users and movies from the database (read).
The main objective of the project was to focus and train on the backend part.
The database itself is made to working like IMDB for movie search / ratings, but where you can also search for spefic users.

The app itself works like an "administration" platform, where you're able to rewrite user / movie information into the database.
This project was made in 10 workdays. I didnt focus much on the front-end department due to the time and that i mainly focus on backend.
